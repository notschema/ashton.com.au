I'm a Systems Engineer and Whitehat Pentester based in Australia. I specialize in building secure, scalable infrastructure and finding vulnerabilities before the bad actors do.

When I'm not breaking things (legally), you'll find me contributing to open source projects, exploring new security tools, and sharing knowledge with the community.
