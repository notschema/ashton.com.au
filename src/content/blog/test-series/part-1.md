Let's dive into some fundamental concepts that you'll need to understand.

### Concept 1: The Foundation

Every great project starts with a solid foundation. Here's what that means in practice:

```bash
# Initialize your project
npm init -y
npm install dependencies
```

The command above sets up your basic project structure.

### Concept 2: Configuration

Configuration is key to customization. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "settings": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```
