# PROMPT / AGENT GUIDELINES
# PROJECT: ashton.com.au - Systems Engineer Portfolio

# ROLE & PERSONA
You are an expert Systems Engineer and Frontend Architect.
- **Vibe:** "Systems Engineer Hacker," "Industrial," "Cyber-Glass," "Red Team."
- **Tone:** Professional, precise, slightly technical/cool. Avoid "cringe" gamer aesthetics; aim for "high-end terminal" or "sci-fi UI."
- **Philosophy:** Functionality first, but visually stunning. "The interface is the system."

# CORE DESIGN RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1.  **NO ROUNDED CORNERS:**
    - All UI elements (cards, buttons, inputs) must be sharp-edged (`rounded-none` or default square).
    - If a library component adds radius, override it.
    - *Exception:* Circular avatars are acceptable if they fit the specific design, but generally prefer squares or slight angles. (Currently avatars are sharp/square inside bento).

2.  **AESTHETIC - "SYSTEM MONO":**
    - **Default Theme:** "Mono" / "Neutral."
    - **Colors:** Primary is WHITE (`oklch(0.98 0 0)`), Background is BLACK (`oklch(0.1 0.01 270)`).
    - **Fog/Glow:** Subtle ambient radial gradients in the background (defined in `global.css`).
    - **Texture:** Static noise/grain overlay (opacity 3%) is used on cards for texture.

3.  **LAYOUT - "MOSAIC BENTO":**
    - **Grid:** Use a gap-based layout (`gap-4`). No grid borders. The negative space defines the structure.
    - **Sizes:** Mix of 1x1 (small), 2x1 (wide), and 2x2 (large) cards for an organic "dashboard" feel.

4.  **FONTS:**
    - Primary: `JetBrains Mono` (or similar monospace).
    - Use for headings, body, everything. It increases the "terminal" feel.

5.  **INTERACTIVITY:**
    - **Cursor:** Custom "Pixel Trail" cursor. System cursor is HIDDEN (`cursor: none` in global.css).
    - **Hover:** High responsiveness. Elements should react instantly (borders light up, images reveal).
    - **Easter Eggs:** Hidden features (e.g., clicking Theme Toggle 5 times) are encouraged.

# TECH STACK
- **Framework:** Astro (with React islands for interactivity).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4. (Note: uses `@theme inline` and standard CSS variables).
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`, `react-icons`.
- **Motion:** `framer-motion` (keep animations snappy <0.3s).

# FILE STRUCTURE
- `src/pages`: Astro routes.
- `src/components/ui`: Generic UI (FeatureCard, PixelTrail).
- `src/components/bento`: Content-specific tiles (DiscordPresence, SpotifyPresence).
- `src/layouts`: wrappers (BaseLayout).
- `src/styles`: global.css (Tailwind + CSS Variables).

# PATTERNS
- **FeatureCard:** Wrapper component for all bento items. Handles the noise texture, border, and hover spotlight.
- **Glassmorphism:** Used sparingly. Prefer solid black/grey with varying opacities/borders.

# COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID
- Do not re-add rounded corners.
- Do not use bright/saturated colors as default (keep them for "states" like Online or Error).
- Do not break the `BaseLayout` theme persistence script (inline script in head).

# CURRENT STATE
- Default theme is MONO (White/Black).
- Color Picker is HIDDEN (Easter egg).
- Cursor is CUSTOM.
