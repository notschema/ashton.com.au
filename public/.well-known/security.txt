# What to report:
# - Did I commit an API key again? Probably. Let me know.
# - Something actually serious? Please yell at me.
# - XSS, SQLi, auth bypass, etc? Very cool, email me.

# What's probably not worth reporting:
# - Missing security headers on a static portfolio site
# - SPF/DKIM/DMARC stuff (I know, I know)
# - "I can see your GitHub repos" - yeah they're public

# Thanks for looking out! 🙏
